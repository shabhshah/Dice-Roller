# Dice-Roller
A simple and complex dice rolling programs I wrote for my programming class.

*simplediceroller.py* rolls two six-sided dice and prints the results along with the sum of the dice.

*copmlexdiceroller.py* allows the user to pick the amount of sides on the dice and how many dice to roll. The results are printed along with the sum of the dice.
